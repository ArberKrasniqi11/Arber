<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Our coffee shop is a small, family-run place where we love making great coffee and delicious pastries. It all started because we wanted to share our love for coffee with our community. Every day, our friendly baristas work hard to make sure you get the perfect cup, whether you’re in a hurry or want to relax. We believe coffee is more than just a drink — it’s a way to bring people together and make your day better.</p>
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>Our mission is to provide a warm and inviting space for everyone to enjoy high-quality coffee and pastries. We are committed to sourcing the best ingredients and supporting local suppliers whenever possible. We believe in sustainability and strive to minimize our environmental impact.</p>
